# Hi there, I'm Jacob Patrix Gonzalez 👋 

### 🏀 Business Student & Aspiring IT/Cybersecurity Analyst | Class of May 2026
I am a **4-year Collegiate Student-Athlete** and **Business Administration Major** currently training to enter the IT and Cybersecurity field. I am focused on bridging the gap between business operations and technical security.

As a **Point Guard**, I’ve spent my college career as the "on-court general," responsible for communication, strategy, and execution under pressure. I am now applying that same disciplined, team-first mindset to technical troubleshooting and digital defense.
